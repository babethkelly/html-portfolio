<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Babeth Kelly and i am a born again Christian and mum of 2 beautiful 
  girls <br/>
  I have 2 passions in my life, Christ and coding
  
</p>

<p>On my Christ's passion, my dream is to help young people 
  to live a fulfilled life in Christ. In fact i wish to tell them or show them that 
  you can live a fulfilled life that please God, you dont have to live a sinful life to be fulfilled
and Christian life do not have to be boring
</p>

<p>On my Coding passion, my dream is to use coding to better and advance the kingdom of God
  I believe it is possible and that the 2 two do not contradict each other
